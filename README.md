# Implementing Algorithm
A list of algorithm that I've tried to implement

## nrmethod.py
I tried to implement a general abstraction to do newton raphson method

## traversal.py
I am learning about how to transform recursion into iteration.
What I've learnt:
- Emulating the working stack with visited flag techniques
This is a general solution I guess, especially for transforming a tree recursions
